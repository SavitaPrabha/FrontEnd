            GRV wants you to be happy with your purchase, even though some

            have any issues, please contact our customer service department. GRV
            group or third party agent will repair furniture with damage that is
            notified within 48 hours of delivery or pick-up. If the item can't
            be fixed, you'll be given an identical replacement at no additional
            cost. If no substitute is available, a reselection will be given.
            Please keep in mind that certain flaws in natural materials like
            wood or leather are to be anticipated and are not considered
            defects.

            Only Canadian addresses are covered by the shipping policies stated
            on this website. The GRV Group retains the right, at its sole
            discretion and without prior notification to the client, to employ
            third-party carriers. Customers who order goods for delivery outside
            of Canada are responsible for making their own shipping
            arrangements. Some of the components pictured may need to be put
            together.

          <ul>
            <li>
              We will make an effort to call you 1-2 days prior to delivery to
              confirm your delivery.
              <br />

              Deliveries begin at 10:00 a.m. and continue until all of the day's
              planned deliveries are completed. Unfortunately, owing to the
              hundreds of supplies that must be routed, precise time estimates
              are difficult to provide.

            </li>
            <li>
              Prior to delivery, an imprint of the credit card(s) used to make
              the purchase, as well as the cardholder's signature and picture
              ID, may be needed for online orders.

            </li>
            <li>
              All delivery orders need the signature of a person 18 years of age
              or older, and that person must accompany the delivery team inside
              your house or apartment.

            </li>
            <li>
              In order to get your furniture, rooms should be emptied. In
              addition, to accept delivery, driveways and pathways should be
              cleaned (i.e. remove snow and ice). Make sure there's a clear
              route from the front door of your house to the room where your new
              furniture will go. We are unable to transfer any existing
              furniture, gadgets, televisions, or computers due to liability
              concerns.
